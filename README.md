# 🐞 Chatterbug

Decided to learn some network programming. First project is this real simple chat server/client. Uses some multithreading on the client side. Plan to greatly expand this skillset and integrate it into some dope ass embedded stuff in the future.

## 📝 TODO

- [ ] Integrate simple build system (running `g++` is getting a little annoying)
- [ ] Create a `chat_msg` data structure to more effectively handle messages
- [ ] Integrate security functionality (TLS encryption if wanting to expose over internet)
- [ ] Clean shutdown
- [ ] Private messaging?
